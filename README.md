# About This Project

This is a relatively simple [Reloaded II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II) Mod Loader mod that modifies the distance at which objects are rendered at. It works by editing the object layout file in memory once it's been loaded.


## How to Use
**A.** Install Reloaded mods as usual. (Extract to mod directory)

**B.** Enable mod and run the game. (This auto-generates the config files: `Config.json`)

**C.** Adjust configuration. (If necessary).
